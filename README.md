# SMS Spam Classifier

This project aims to build a machine learning model to classify SMS messages as either spam or not spam (ham). The model is trained on a dataset of labeled SMS messages to accurately predict whether a given message is spam or not.

## Introduction

The SMS Spam Classifier is a machine learning project developed to help users identify and filter out spam messages from their inbox. It utilizes natural language processing techniques and a classification algorithm to predict whether an incoming SMS message is spam or not. The model's accuracy and performance make it a valuable tool for anyone looking to reduce the clutter in their messaging inbox.

## Installation

To run the SMS Spam Classifier project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/AnalyticalShivam/spam-classifier.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

After installing the necessary dependencies, run the main script to use the SMS Spam Classifier:

```
app.py
```

This script will prompt the user to input an SMS message and will return whether the message is classified as spam or not.

## Dataset

The SMS Spam Classifier project uses the SMS Spam Collection dataset, which contains a set of SMS messages that have been labeled as either spam or ham. The dataset is preprocessed and split into training and testing sets for model training and evaluation.

## Model

The SMS Spam Classifier employs a machine learning model based on natural language processing techniques and a classification algorithm (e.g., Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, or deep learning models). The model is trained on the labeled dataset to learn patterns and features that distinguish spam messages from legitimate ones.

## Results

The performance of the SMS Spam Classifier is evaluated based on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The README will be updated with the specific results and performance metrics achieved by the model.
